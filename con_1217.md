## Details
 **Description:** A large wild fish caught from lakes or rivers is placed into a large metal stove and stewed slowly with all kinds of vegetables. Meanwhile, flat breads made out of corn flour are heated on the side of the pot. This dish is a local dish enjoyed in farms in the Northeast Region. This particular pot of food still seems rather raw.
