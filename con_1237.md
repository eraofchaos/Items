## Details
 **Description:** Three coconuts are required to make each portion of the soup base. A young coconut is added to provide moisture, an old coconut is added for a strong coconut fragrance, and a mature coconut is added to ensure the dish's sweetness. Add fresh chicken pieces to this dish to make a simple hotpot with a complex taste. This particular pot of food seems to be insufficiently heated.

 **Quality:** <span style="color: #DA70D6">OK</span>
